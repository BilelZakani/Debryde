In this project, We played the role of a company designing a sensor box. 

This box allows the brewer to monitor several parameters of his beer during the fermentation period, such as temperature, density, etc.
Then the brewer will have a permanent view of his beer, and be able to adapt his methods accordingly.

Although this project was carried out in a group of 8 people, our work was as close as possible to an engineer's one.

We divided up the tasks using the specs and set up an organization using a GANTT chart.

We then studied and established the perfect conditions for our box to take full advantage of our sensors.

I took care of data reception with the user interface, research on a pressure sensor and on the density sensor.

The report is in French because my school is based in that country.

Hope you enjoy !
